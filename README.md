# Thunder Shunt
Wire-wound shunt resistor holders

Inspired by [this](https://youtu.be/j4u8fl31sgQ) video from Electroboom, this FreeCAD model is a fully parametric shunt resistor wire spool.

## Instructions
1. Open the file in FreeCAD.
2. Open the spreadsheet `params` and modify as needed.
  - Cylinder OD, Height, and Thickness change the base cylinder.
  - Set the Wire Holes ID to fit the wire being used.
  - Set the Slots width and depth to fit the zip-ties being used. Change the number to match how many zip-ties will be used.
3. The part design body will update automatically. If it does not, check that your parameters aren't conflicting (i.e. overlapping zip-tie slots).
4. Export and slice with your program of choice, print, and enjoy!
